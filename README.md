## About the challenge

This is my proposed solution that I managed to do with the time I was given. Beforehand I apologise for not having developed any tests as I ran out of time before I could do so.

Before running the app one needs to num "npm install"

This app was created with create-react-app boiler plate so, to run it locally one just needs to run "npm start"

Bear in mind that I used my own token on the tests to be able to make calls to the API so, if needed, one can change the api key in LandingPage.js:14
